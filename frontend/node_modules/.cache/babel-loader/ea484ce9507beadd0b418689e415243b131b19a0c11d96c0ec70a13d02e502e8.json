Along the way, she met a big, bad wolf. \"Where are you going, little girl?\" asked the wolf with a sly smile.\n\n\"I'm going to my grandmother's cottage to bring her some food,\" said Little Red Riding Hood innocently.\n\nThe wolf had a wicked plan. He ran ahead to the grandmother's cottage and knocked on the door. When the grandmother opened it, he swallowed her up in one gulp! Then he put on her nightgown and cap and got into her bed.\n\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange. \"Oh grandmother,\" she said, \"what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see you with,\" replied the wolf.\n\n\"And grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear you with.\"\n\n\"And grandmother, what big teeth you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you with!\" roared the wolf, jumping out of bed.\n\nJust then, a huntsman who was passing by heard the commotion.

She lives in the cottage in the forest, and she's feeling unwell.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set off through the forest. Along the way, she met a big, bad wolf. \"Where are you going, little girl?\" asked the wolf with a sly smile.\n\n\"I'm going to my grandmother's cottage to bring her some food,\" said Little Red Riding Hood innocently.\n\nThe wolf had a wicked plan. He ran ahead to the grandmother's cottage and knocked on the door. When the grandmother opened it, he swallowed her up in one gulp! Then he put on her nightgown and cap and got into her bed.\n\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange. \"Oh grandmother,\" she said, \"what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see you with,\" replied the wolf.\n\n\"And grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear you with.\"\n\n\"And grandmother, what big teeth you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you with!\" roared the wolf, jumping out of bed.\n\nJust then, a huntsman who was passing by heard the commotion. He burst into the cottage and saved Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother.\n\nFrom that day on, Little Red Riding Hood always stayed on the path and never talked to strangers in the forest.\n\nThe End.`\n        },\n        {\n          id: '2',\n          title: 'The Three Little Pigs',\n          description: 'Three pigs build houses to protect themselves from the big bad wolf',\n          category: 'fairy_tales',\n          duration: '6 min',\n          age_group: '3-7',\n          content: `Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who decided to build their own houses.\n\nThe first little pig was lazy and built his house out of straw.

Step by step, he made his way across the meadow. He passed the sleeping hare and continued toward the finish line.\n\nWhen the hare woke up, the sun was setting.

There was the tortoise, just steps away from winning!\n\nThe hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late.
