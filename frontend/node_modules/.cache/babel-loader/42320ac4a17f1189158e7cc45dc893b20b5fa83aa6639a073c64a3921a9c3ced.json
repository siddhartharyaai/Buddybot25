He ran ahead to the grandmother's cottage and knocked on the door. When the grandmother opened it, he swallowed her up in one gulp! Then he put on her nightgown and cap and got into her bed.\n\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange. \"Oh grandmother,\" she said, \"what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see you with,\" replied the wolf.\n\n\"And grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear you with.\"\n\n\"And grandmother, what big teeth you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you with!\" roared the wolf, jumping out of bed.\n\nJust then, a huntsman who was passing by heard the commotion.
