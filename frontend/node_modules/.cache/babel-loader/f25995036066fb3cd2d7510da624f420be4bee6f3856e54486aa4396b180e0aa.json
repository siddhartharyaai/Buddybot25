He ran ahead to the grandmother's cottage and knocked on the door. When the grandmother opened it, he swallowed her up in one gulp! Then he put on her nightgown and cap and got into her bed.\n\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange. \"Oh grandmother,\" she said, \"what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see you with,\" replied the wolf.\n\n\"And grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear you with.\"\n\n\"And grandmother, what big teeth you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you with!\" roared the wolf, jumping out of bed.\n\nJust then, a huntsman who was passing by heard the commotion.

the forest. She always wore a red riding cloak, so everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nOne day, her mother said, \"Little Red Riding Hood, take this basket of food to your grandmother. She lives in the cottage in the forest, and she's feeling unwell.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set off through the forest. Along the way, she met a big, bad wolf. \"Where are you going, little girl?\" asked the wolf with a sly smile.\n\n\"I'm going to my grandmother's cottage to bring her some food,\" said Little Red Riding Hood innocently.\n\nThe wolf had a wicked plan. He ran ahead to the grandmother's cottage and knocked on the door. When the grandmother opened it, he swallowed her up in one gulp! Then he put on her nightgown and cap and got into her bed.\n\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange. \"Oh grandmother,\" she said, \"what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see you with,\" replied the wolf.\n\n\"And grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear you with.\"\n\n\"And grandmother, what big teeth you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you with!\" roared the wolf, jumping out of bed.\n\nJust then, a huntsman who was passing by heard the commotion. He burst into the cottage and saved Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother.\n\nFrom that day on, Little Red Riding Hood always stayed on the path and never talked to strangers in the forest.\n\nThe End.`\n        },\n        {\n          id: '2',\n          title: 'The Three Little Pigs',\n          description: 'Three pigs build houses to protect themselves from the big bad wolf',\n          category: 'fairy_tales',\n          duration: '6 min',\n          age_group: '3-7',\n          content: `Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who decided to build their own houses.\n\nThe first little pig was lazy and built his house out of straw.

He couldn't blow it down!\n\nThe wolf tried to climb down the chimney, but the clever third pig had a pot of boiling water ready.

He would often boast to all the other animals, \"I'm the fastest animal in the whole forest! No one can beat me in a race!\"\n\nOne day, the tortoise, who was tired of listening to the hare's bragging, said quietly, \"I challenge you to a race.\"\n\nAll the animals laughed. \"You want to race the hare?\" they giggled. \"But you're so slow!\"\n\nThe hare laughed the loudest. \"This will be the easiest race I've ever won!\" he said.\n\nThe fox offered to be the judge, and all the animals gathered to watch the race. The fox marked the starting line and the finish line, which was on the other side of the meadow.\n\n\"Ready, set, go!\" called the fox.\n\nThe hare zoomed off like lightning, leaving the tortoise far behind. Soon, the hare was so far ahead that he couldn't even see the tortoise anymore.\n\n\"This is too easy,\" thought the hare. \"I have plenty of time. I think I'll take a little nap under this shady tree.\"\n\nThe hare curled up under the tree and fell fast asleep.\n\nMeanwhile, the tortoise kept moving slowly but steadily. Step by step, he made his way across the meadow. He passed the sleeping hare and continued toward the finish line.\n\nWhen the hare woke up, the sun was setting. He stretched and yawned, then remembered the race. He looked toward the finish line and couldn't believe his eyes. There was the tortoise, just steps away from winning!\n\nThe hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise crossed the finish line first!\n\nAll the animals cheered for the tortoise.
