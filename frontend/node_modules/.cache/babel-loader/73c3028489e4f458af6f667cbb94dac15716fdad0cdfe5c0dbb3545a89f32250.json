He ran ahead to the grandmother's cottage and knocked on the door. When the grandmother opened it, he swallowed her up in one gulp! Then he put on her nightgown and cap and got into her bed.\n\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange. \"Oh grandmother,\" she said, \"what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see you with,\" replied the wolf.\n\n\"And grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear you with.\"\n\n\"And grandmother, what big teeth you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you with!\" roared the wolf, jumping out of bed.\n\nJust then, a huntsman who was passing by heard the commotion.

She lives in the cottage in the forest, and she's feeling unwell.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set off through the forest. Along the way, she met a big, bad wolf. \"Where are you going, little girl?\" asked the wolf with a sly smile.\n\n\"I'm going to my grandmother's cottage to bring her some food,\" said Little Red Riding Hood innocently.\n\nThe wolf had a wicked plan. He ran ahead to the grandmother's cottage and knocked on the door. When the grandmother opened it, he swallowed her up in one gulp! Then he put on her nightgown and cap and got into her bed.\n\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange. \"Oh grandmother,\" she said, \"what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see you with,\" replied the wolf.\n\n\"And grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear you with.\"\n\n\"And grandmother, what big teeth you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you with!\" roared the wolf, jumping out of bed.\n\nJust then, a huntsman who was passing by heard the commotion.

There was the tortoise, just steps away from winning!\n\nThe hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late.
